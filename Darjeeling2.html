                <p class="rughuerh">Lepchajagat is a serene hamlet located at an altitude of 6959ft, concealed amidst the lush forest of rhododendron and oak trees. It is situated 19km from Darjeeling and is a hidden gem that is free from the tourist rush. The name Lepchajagat comes from the word "Jagat" which means "the world", so it was the world of the Lepchas. It was once used to be a hamlet of the Lepcha tribes³. Subsequently, it was taken over by the West Bengal Forest Development Corporation (WBFDC) and now a reserved forest area³. Lepchajagat with its serene ambiance and pictorial view of Mt. Kanchenjunga has bewitched the mind of many tourists traveling in Darjeeling³. Enclosed by the rich forested area, far from the maddening crowd and hassle of daily life, Lepchajagat has become the safe haven for tourists who are looking for solitude amidst wildlife³. The only sound which one can hear while visiting or staying in Lepchajagat is during day time the melodious chirping of exquisite Himalayan bird and at evening sound made by the small insects like cricket³. Witnessing the sunrise over the third highest mountain peak Mt. Kanchenjunga from the top of Lepchajagat can be a phenomenal experience for any nature lover. </p>
